            <p>Education is vital to children because education helps children learn how to think critically, enhances
                their creativity and imagination, will expose them to new ideas, and it helps the child find the path to
                a career that they wish to pursue as an adult.</p>

                your donation</h1>
            <p>Because of your loving donations, you are saving the sickest, most medically neglected children suffering
                in severe pain with devastating terminal diseases — sadly forgotten by other charities. Their lives
                depend on your donations. Your donations help them to NEVER run out of life-saving surgeries, pain
                medicines, bandages, antibiotics, oxygen, ventilators and wound-healing nutrition. You can save them and
                reduce their severe pain. We can’t thank our great-hearted donors enough for caring about saving the
                sickest children. We invite you to be a very special part of this Mission.

            <p>We cannot stop natural disasters but we can arm ourselves with knowledge: so many lives wouldn't have to
                be lost if there was enough disaster preparedness. We all can do our bit. Let's feed the hungry and help
                the less fortunate among us. Together we can make this world a better place.
